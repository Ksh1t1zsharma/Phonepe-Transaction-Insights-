# Data directory

This folder describes where to place your dataset files to run the notebook.

Expected layout:

- data/
  - raw/             # Put original downloaded data files here (do NOT commit)
    - transactions/  # example: JSON/CSV per date or per state (PhonePe Pulse)
    - users/
    - maps/          # optional shapefiles or GeoJSON for choropleth maps
  - processed/       # generated by the notebook (safe to add to .gitignore)

How to obtain data:
- Download PhonePe Pulse data from the official PhonePe/third-party source and place the files under `data/raw/transactions/`. Adjust the notebook file-reading cells to match the filenames you downloaded.

Naming & format:
- If the notebook expects JSON or CSV files with certain columns (for example: state, district, transaction_count, transaction_amount, date, category), keep those column names or update the ingestion code to match your file format.

Notes:
- Large raw files should not be committed to the repo. Use cloud storage or share a small sample for reproduction.
